    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bitterballen are a classic Dutch snack, typically served as a delicious appetizer. These crispy, deep-fried croquettes are filled with a rich, flavorful mixture of slow-cooked beef ragout, then coated in breadcrumbs. Perfectly golden on the outside and tender on the inside, they are usually enjoyed with mustard for dipping. A popular choice at parties and bars, bitterballen are a comforting treat that offers a savory bite in every crunchy morsel.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Bitterballen</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Butter -</strong> Unsalted as we want to control the sodium content of our dish</li>
        <li><strong>Flour - </strong>All purpose works just fine as a base for our roux.</li>
        <li><strong>Broth -</strong> We're using low sodium beef broth. As we're cooking with beef we want to carry that beef flavor all the way through</li>
        <li><strong>Beef -</strong> Ground beef, I used regular but feel free to use lean if you'd like to cut back on fat</li>
        <li><strong>Onion -</strong> 1 small onion, something that cooks down well like white or yellow</li>
        <li><strong>Nutmeg -</strong> This spice may seem like a strange addition, but it pairs beautifully with our savory flavors and rounds out our flavor profiles nicely</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning -</strong> Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Meatballs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Create the roux:</strong> In a large skillet melt the butter over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted completely, add the 1 cup of flour, a bit at a time, whisking it, it will turn into a thick paste</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the gravy: </strong>Slowly stir or whisk in the beef broth. Make sure you stir thoroughly, the broth should all be incorporated in the roux, the gravy should be smooth but still quite thick. Simmer the gravy for a couple minutes then add the parsley, onion, and ground beef, stir well before seasoning with salt and pepper and adding the nutmeg</li>
        <li><strong>Solidify the gravy:</strong> Transfer the meat mixture to a Tupperware container and refrigerate for several hours until the gravy has solidified. I refrigerated mine overnight, but 3 or 4 hours should suffice</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Fry</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the meatballs:</strong> Fry the meatballs about 6 at a time until golden brown, should take about 4 or 5 minutes. If you have enough oil in your fryer the meatballs will float to the top when done.  Continue until done with all the meatballs
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finish the dish: </strong>Serve hot with a grainy or spicy mustard.</li>
    </ol>
