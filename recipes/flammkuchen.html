    <p>
        Flammkuchen is a crispy flatbread topped with creme fraiche, 
        bacon (Speck or lardons depending on the region), and onions that comes 
        from the Alsace region of France. It was created by German settlers so 
        it's not only popular in France but also in Germany and Austria.

    <p>
        It's often called German pizza in the US but the dough is not leavened with yeast 
        (or any other leavening agent) so this is rather a flatbread than a pizza. 
        It's rolled out thin and comes out super crispy. It's usually rolled out into an 
        oval shape rather than to a circle but you can shape it as you want.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>olive oil (or any other vegetable oil)</li>
        <li>very warm water (it makes the dough more soft and easier to roll out)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The toppings:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Speck (used in German-speaking countries) or lardons 
            (used in France, this is a cured and not smoked type of bacon). 
            You can use thick-cut bacon instead. Regular, thinly sliced bacon 
            will also work but it's more prone to burning and I think thick-cut 
            bacon adds more texture and the flavor is somehow better. 
            Speck is traditionally cut into small cubes. Speck and bacon are both 
            made from smoked pork belly but their seasonings and the type of wood used 
            to smoke them are a little bit different. This recipe calls for German-style 
            Speck (like Jausenspeck/Bauchspeck/Frühstucksspeck) and not an Italian 
            (south Tyrolean) type of Speck (Italian Speck is similar to prosciutto ham).
        </li>
        <li>
            Crème fraîche. Creme fraiche is a similar product to sour cream but it's 
            less sour, thicker, and has a higher fat content. You can substitute 
            it with Greek yogurt or sour cream mixed with 1-2 Tbsp of olive oil. 
            Creme fraiche is best though, so use this if you can find it (you can even make it 
            yourself - check out this recipe for creme fraiche). 
            In Germany, creme fraiche or Schmand is used 
            (this is sour cream with 20% fat content instead of 12%)
        </li>
        <li>
            Onion - traditionally, raw onion is being used but you can also saute it 
            with butter if you wish.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium/large mixing bowl stir the flour with salt.</li>
        <li>
            Add the olive oil and very warm water (from the tap). 
            Stir with a wooden spoon until roughly combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead the dough by hand or with a stand mixer fitted with a 
            dough hook attachment for a couple of minutes until the dough is soft and smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in plastic foil and set it aside to rest for 20-30 minutes (on the counter).</li>
        <li>
            Prepare the ingredients: cut bacon into small cubes. 
            Cut onions into thin slices and sprinkle them with a pinch 
            of salt (they will soften and not burn in a hot oven). 
            Add the creme fraiche into a small bowl, season it with 
            salt and pepper, and stir until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll out the dough very thinly into an oval or rectangular shape and place 
            it on a baking sheet lightly greased with olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>Spread the creme fraiche over the dough leaving some border.</li>
        <li>Top with bacon and onion slices (if they released some water, squeeze it out).</li>
    </ol>
