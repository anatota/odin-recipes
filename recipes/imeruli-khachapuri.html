    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Imeruli Khachapuri is a traditional Georgian cheese-filled bread from the 
        Imereti region. Unlike its boat-shaped Adjarian counterpart, 
        Imeruli Khachapuri is round and stuffed with a delicious mixture of tangy, 
        melty cheese, typically a blend of Imeretian and sulguni cheeses. 
        The dough is soft yet slightly crispy on the outside, making it a perfect 
        comfort food for any occasion. Serve it warm for the best experience!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ cups (450g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) warm milk</li>
        <li>1 packet (7g) dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (250g) Imeretian cheese (or a mix of feta and mozzarella)</li>
        <li>1 cup (125g) sulguni cheese (or a mix of mozzarella and provolone)</li>
        <li>1 egg (optional, for creamier filling)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Brushing:</h3>
    <ul><li>2 tbsp melted butter</li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the warm milk, sugar, and dry yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and vegetable oil.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. If it's too sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough with a kitchen towel and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Make the Filling:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Grate or crumble the cheeses into a bowl. If using an egg, mix it into the cheese for a creamier texture.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble the Khachapuri:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into two equal portions.</li>
                <li>Roll out one portion into a circle about 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter.</li>
                <li>Place half of the cheese filling in the center, leaving space around the edges.</li>
                <li>Fold the edges of the dough over the filling, gathering them toward the center. Pinch to seal and gently flatten into a thick, round disc.</li>
                <li>Carefully flip the dough over, so the sealed side is underneath, and roll it out slightly to an even thickness (about ½ inch or 1.5 cm). Repeat with the second portion of dough and filling.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the khachapuri on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown on top.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven and immediately brush with melted butter.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong><br>
            <span>Let the khachapuri cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm and enjoy!</span>
